# SplatHat
Splatoon 3 headgear in Lethal Company, ripped directly from Splatoon 3.

Currently limited to Splatoon 3. May do Splatoon 2 too in the future.

## Dependencies
Although the mod's `manifest.json` doesn't say any dependencies, you will need MoreCompany for this to work.  
The reason this dependency is not specified is because there are other mods that implement MoreCompany, such as AdvancedCompany.

## Current List of Headgear
- Classic Straw Boater

### Headgear Requests
