# SplatHat
Splatoon 3 headgear in Lethal Company, ripped directly from Splatoon 3.

Currently limited to Splatoon 3. May do Splatoon 2 too in the future.

## Dependencies
Although the mod's `manifest.json` doesn't say any dependencies, you will need MoreCompany for this to work.  
The reason this dependency is not specified is because there are other mods that implement MoreCompany, such as AdvancedCompany.

## Current List of Headgear
- 3D Glasses (Hed_COP120)
- Classic Straw Boater (Hed_HAT006)

### Headgear Requests
If you want a certain hat to be in Lethal Company, please create a new issue for the request and specify the followings:
- The headgear's name
- Your favourite colour for that headgear (if applicable)

If you get a response, it should be done in 1 or 2 days, unless otherwise specified.
